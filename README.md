ELASTIC SEARCH LAB

Objective
The lab also aims to demonstrate how Elasticsearch can be used in cybersecurity contexts for real-time log analysis, threat detection, and incident response.

Skills Learned
- Elasticsearch Setup and Configuration: Gained hands-on experience installing and configuring Elasticsearch nodes and clusters.
- Indexing and Data Ingestion: Learned how to index data manually and through automated ingestion using tools like Logstash and Filebeat.
- Data Analysis and Visualization: Used Kibana to create visualizations and dashboards for log analysis and anomaly detection.
- Log Parsing and Filtering: Practiced parsing raw log data to identify key fields, patterns, and potential security events.
- SIEM Integration Concepts: Understood how Elasticsearch can serve as a core component of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.
- Threat Detection Techniques: Identified and flagged suspicious activities in logs based on real-world indicators of compromise (IOCs).



Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
